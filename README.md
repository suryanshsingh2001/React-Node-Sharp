## Objective 🎯
Build a full-stack image processing web application that accepts image uploads, processes them on the backend, and provides real-time previews of the manipulated image. Users can download the final processed image in their desired format (PNG or JPEG).

---

## Local Setup Instructions 🛠️

### Frontend Setup:
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: 
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
3. Set up the environment variables:
    - Copy the contents from `.envexample` to `.env`. You can find the file [here](https://github.com/suryanshsingh2001/FilterPixel-Task/blob/main/frontend/.envExample)
4. Start the frontend development server: 
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Open your browser at the provided URL to interact with the web application.

### Backend Setup:
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: 
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```
3. Start the backend server: 
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Tech Stack 💻

### Backend:
- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express** - Web framework for creating REST APIs
- **Multer** - Middleware for handling file uploads
- **Sharp** - Library for high-performance image processing
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and maintainability

### Frontend:
- **React** - Frontend library for building user interfaces
- **Context API** - State management across components
- **TypeScript** - Type safety for better code structure and error handling
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **ShadcnUI** - React component library for UI elements

## Image Storage 🗂️

- **Uploads Folder**: 
  - `uploads/original`: Contains the original image uploaded by the user.
  - `uploads/preview`: Contains the preview images generated after real-time processing.
  
- **Exports Folder**: 
  - Contains all the final exported high-quality images after processing for user download.
  
- **Static Files**: Both `uploads` and `exports` directories are exposed as static files, making the images accessible through the frontend for previews and downloads.

---

## Main Components 🧩

### 1. **ImageControls**
- Handles the various image manipulations (brightness, contrast, saturation, rotation, cropping).
- Contains sliders for real-time adjustment of the image properties.
- Sends real-time updates to the backend for immediate preview feedback.

### 2. **ImagePreview**
- Displays the real-time preview of the manipulated image.
- Updates dynamically as the user changes brightness, contrast, saturation, and rotation.
- Shows the cropped version of the image after cropping is applied.

### 3. **ImageUpload**
- Component responsible for handling image uploads from the user.
- Validates the image format (PNG/JPEG) before sending it to the backend.
- Provides a preview of the uploaded image before any manipulations.

### 4. **ImageDownload**
- Allows users to download the final processed image.
- Provides options for the user to choose the image format (PNG or JPEG) before downloading.
- Fetches the high-quality image from the backend and prompts the user to save it locally.
